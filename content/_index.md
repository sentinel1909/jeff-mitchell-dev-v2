## Hey, I'm Jeff!

### Welcome to my corner.

I'm a self-taught, hobbyist developer, IT generalize and junkie, and all around old school metaller. Welcome to my site! This site is somewhat of a mix-tape/reflection of myself.

Here you'll find my thoughts about programming languages and software development in general. I'm no computer scientist, so don't expect deep dives from an expert's perspective. I'm a guy messing about with stuff that he has no right to. I mostly like Rust, but will explore and write about other languages from time to time. I'll also write about my love of heavy metal music, which hopefully might influence exploration of your own. The Projects page will contain a bit of a dive into whatever mini-project I'm fiddling about with.

I long for a web where you're not fed fake AI generated slop or exploited by an algorithm.

I will never employ ads, trackers, or ask for money. My content is here for you to enjoy and benefit from. In putting myself out there, I hope to inspire others to do the same.

### What's New

Somehow, some way, it's January in the Year of Our Lord 2025. Time is passing. It's a new month and a new year. I'm starting with some ambitous Rust goals, ambitious in the sense that I'm even setting goals at all. Gonna keep it one month at a time though, lest I set myself up for failure.

January's goal is to help the [Shuttle](https://shuttle.dev) crew with a re-write of this tutorial article: [URL Shortener](https://docs.shuttle.dev/templates/tutorials/url-shortener). I'm also taking the opportunity to make this project into my very first actual software product...primarily for myself, but perhaps in time used by others. I need to start actually trying to do something with this coding journey I've been on.

My non-Rust goal is to get better acquainted with Databases. I'm tired of Googling for random how-tos and disconnected bits of information. I'm now taking the "Complete SQL Database Bootcamp" offered by [Zero to Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io). I purchased a lifetime membership there awhile back, their content, courses, and Discord community are second to none.

### Rust Crate of the Week

The Rust crate of this week is [Hyper](https://hyper.rs). Off and on, I've been learning about how to use HTTP in Rust programs. Hyper is the de-facto standard that the community has coalesced around. Many Rust tools have roots in Hyper, such as the [Axum](https://crates.io/crates/axum) web framework and the [Reqwest}(https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) HTTP client library.

### Special Announcements

I recently subscribed to the [Rust Trends](https://rust-trends.com/) newsletter. I highly recommend subscribing, loads of great content there. I reached out to the owner and requested if I could link from here and he graciously agreed.
