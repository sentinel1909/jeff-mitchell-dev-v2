## Hey, I'm Jeff!

### Welcome to my corner.

I'm a self-taught, hobbyist developer, IT generalize and junkie, and all around old school metaller. Welcome to my site! This site is somewhat of a mix-tape/reflection of myself.

Here you'll find my thoughts about programming languages and software development in general. I'm no computer scientist, so don't expect deep dives from an expert's perspective. I'm a guy messing about with stuff that he has no right to. I mostly like Rust, but will explore and write about other languages from time to time. I'll also write about my love of heavy metal music, which hopefully might influence exploration of your own. The Projects page will contain a bit of a dive into whatever mini-project I'm fiddling about with.

I long for a web where you're not fed fake AI generated slop or exploited by an algorithm.

I will never employ ads, trackers, or ask for money. My content is here for you to enjoy and benefit from. In putting myself out there, I hope to inspire others to do the same.

### What's New

December is just about done. This site and blog were quiet for December as I was engrossed in Shuttle's Christmas Code Hunt (CCH 2024). I didn't complete it, and it was equal parts enjoyable and frustrating. I learned quite a bit and now have to start unpacking some of that here.

### Rust Crate of the Week

The Rust crate of the week is [leaky-bucket](https://crates.io/crates/leaky-bucket). This crate gives you a token-based rate limiter based on the [leaky bucket algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket). This crate was a great help in Day 9 of Shuttle's CCH 2024 edition, in which we had to build a milk and cookies production factory for Santa.

### Special Announcements

Happy New Year everyone! 2025 is almost on our doorstep. This site was a little too quiet in the later half of the year. Gonna get back at it!
