## Hey, I'm Jeff!

### Welcome to my corner.

I'm a self-taught, hobbyist developer, IT generalize and junkie, and all around old school metaller. Welcome to my site! This site is somewhat of a mix-tape/reflection of myself.

Here you'll find my thoughts about programming languages and software development in general. I'm no computer scientist, so don't expect deep dives from an expert's perspective. I'm a guy messing about with stuff that he has no right to. I mostly like Rust, but will explore and write about other languages from time to time. I'll also write about my love of heavy metal music, which hopefully might influence exploration of your own. The Projects page will contain a bit of a dive into whatever mini-project I'm fiddling about with.

I long for a web where you're not fed fake AI generated slop or exploited by an algorithm.

I will never employ ads, trackers, or ask for money. My content is here for you to enjoy and benefit from. In putting myself out there, I hope to inspire others to do the same.

### What's New

Added a link to [John's Codes](https://johns.codes). Great post there about building a chess engine in Zig, which has me thinking about doing something similar...in Rust.

Note that the form on the Contact page is active and will send me an email via Web3Forms. I spent some time today to make the layout look a little better.

### Rust Crate of the Week

The Rust crate of the week is [Sycamore](https://sycamore.dev). I dabbled a little with this Rust UI library a couple of years ago, but the project seemed to hit a rough patch and felt like a bit of a dead end, so I drifted away. At the start of November, they've come roaring back with a major 0.9 update and a fresh web site. Check it out!
