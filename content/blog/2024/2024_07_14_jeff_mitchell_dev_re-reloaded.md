# The Road So Far...

It's said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.

It embarrasses me to think on how many times I've tried to start a blog.

Wordpress, Zola, Medium, roll-your-own, micro-blogging with Twitter (now X), probably some tools I've forgotten...I've tried and failed so many times.

It's really shameful, the amount of time spent...wasted really.

The core problem, in all the efforts so far, is a focus on the "platform", rather than the "writing". I say I want to write, yet if I'm honest with myself I avoid it by all these platform iterations.

No more...really this time, no more.

# The Road Ahead...

Welcome to the latest, and hopefully last, iteration of my developer oriented blog, built on [Zola](https://getzola.org), a static site generator built in Rust. I hope to learn and write about Zola in the time ahead, as there is very little content out there about it. I did write quite a lot of content through mid-2022 to the end of 2023, so I'll be tidying that up and getting it up here.

I say "developer", yet I should be careful. I'm a hobbyist who thinks he can be a software developer. I run before I walk most of the time and spend far too many hours just slinging code at the Rust compiler hoping something sticks. I can get away with that because it's all just a hobby and my day job doesn't depend on it.

That said, I hope you'll derive some benefit from reading. Rust is less than 10 years old and all things considered is still just starting out. Here, in my writing, I'll provide my own perspective in learning Rust, which hopefully, you'll find somethign that benefits.

For now there is no comments section, nor am I planning one anytime soon. The internet is horrible, no, people on the internet are horrible, and I'd rather not hear from them. If what you read here leaves you the feeling I'm an idiot who's full of shit, stop reading and move on.

Thanks for spending time here and I do hope you derive some benefit, however small, to enable your own Rust questing.
