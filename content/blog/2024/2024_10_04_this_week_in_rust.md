Falling back on old habits again, that being late with my link to [This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2024/10/02/this-week-in-rust-567/).

I'm off for a couple of weeks, with an eye to re-inventing myself just a little bit. I'm constantly feeling annoyed/disappointed/frustrated with who I am as person. Must be my own version of a mid-life crisis. Anyhow, I will not bore you with anything about this right now.

I started exploring [Leptos](https://leptos.dev) a little this week, via a re-do of my [NASA Imagery Viewer](https://nasa-imagery-viewer-v2-xggw.shuttle.app). Overall, Leptos is not that much different from Yew. Reactivity and the notion of signals are a lot to digest...and I'm still digesting. I can also see I'm going to have to seriously brush up on closures and how to use them. Much of what you need in Leptos around reactivity is done with closures.

I will keep Yew in the toolbelt, but to be frank, I feel it's going to die. There seems to be zero activity around it and zero effort to move the framework forward, which I guess doesn't matter, as it works in it's current state. Leptos seems to have a lot of momentum behind it and the documentation is far better than that for Yew.

There's no harm in knowing both.

Also, this is sacrilege, but I *may* return to dabbling in JavaScript and continue learning React. I know, I know, utter heresy from a self-professed Rust shill. Here's the thing. I was admonished months ago by the internet to level up and be less language centric. After all, languages are secondary and the real superpower is problem solving and picking the right tool for the job. Also, in this modern age, knowing JavaScript is unfortunately a must. All this stuff I'm doing with WebAssembly on the front end is loaded into the browser by, you guessed it, JavaScript.

I do want to level up and be less Rust centric.

It's going to take a long time though.

That's all for this week. Hope your own Rust adventures are going well.
