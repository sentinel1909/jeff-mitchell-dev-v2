Hello everyone, I'm back in businesss with this blog. Following up on my "technical difficulties" post, turns out it was a skill issue that knocked me offline.

The moral of the story is, learn properly when, where, and why to sanitize the paths of incoming requests. Don't implement things just because you think you need to.

Here is a link to last week's [TWIR issue](https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2024/10/09/this-week-in-rust-568/).

Lot's of good things in there.

My own week in Rust was not productive, as it was consumed with figuring out why I knocked this blog offline. I have moved it to the new Shuttle platform, which entered public preview last week. Here is there announcement: [New Platform Announcement](https://www.shuttle.dev/blog/2024/10/10/shuttle-redefining-backend-development)

In terms of what I'm learning, I'm taking a break from any language at the moment. I'm doing Jayson Lennon's Vim course on Zero to Mastery. It's slow going, as I'm focused on the basics to start building muscle memory. I can see the benefit of not taking my hands of the keyboard.

If I step back and objectively look, despite my innate negativity, I've made a lot of progress in the past year. I'm likely going to take the rest of the year off, learning wise, and double down on properly learning Zola. I'm using a pre-made theme, which is not supported any longer by its author. I'd like to update it and make it my own. There are few true resources for learning Zola and I'd like to create something of quality to help others.

Stay tuned!
