Hi everyone, I'm a day late with my linkup to [This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2024/08/28/this-week-in-rust-562/).

I'm down in Seattle for the two Metallica shows that are happening tomorrow and Sunday, yesterday was a travel day down from Vancouver AND I brought my work laptop which was not as fully configured for personal development stuff as my normal computers. Up to speed now.

Noticed that the article I wrote for Shuttle, [Rust as my First Language](https://www.shuttle.rs/blog/2024/08/23/rust-as-my-first-language) made it into this week's edition, neat!

Anyways, enjoy your TWIR fix for this week.
