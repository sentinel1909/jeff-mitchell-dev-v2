Hi everyone, I'm a day late with my linkup to [This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2024/09/04/this-week-in-rust-563/).

As usual, loads of great content to digest this week. The article I highlighted yesterday, about the option of alternate executors, is in the mix.

In other Rust news, Rust 1.81 is live today. Read all the details on the [Rust Blog](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/09/05/Rust-1.81.0.html)
