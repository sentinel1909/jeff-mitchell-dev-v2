I know, I know, I should be finishing the long-promised Hash Map article. It's coming, it's coming...I just had to get something off my chest first. I go off on random quests on things that no sane person would do, like using nothing by Hyper and Tokio to build a server. I've done that, created a skeleton, and added a link to the repo on the [projects](@/projects/_index.md) page.

In terms of use, I'm not sure this Hyper adventure will ever turn into anything particularly useful. I'm interested in creating a bullet journaling system for myself, but it's not likely that vague notion will ever become reality.

In the meantime, give your head a shake and don't follow in my footsteps by raw-dogging the Hyper crate...remember, you've been warned.
