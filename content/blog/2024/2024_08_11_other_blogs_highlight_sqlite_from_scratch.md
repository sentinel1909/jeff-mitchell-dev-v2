Happy Sunday!

As I ate my breakfast this morning, I did my usual surfing around the internet. Found this article via daily.dev: [Build your own SQLite, Part 1: Listing tables](https://blog.sylver.dev/build-your-own-sqlite-part-1-listing-tables)

This fits nicely with something in my head the past few days, the notion of building everything myself and not relying on anyone else. This is completely unrealistic, I know this, but it's just something I'm toying with as a way of improving my problem solving ability. I've developed enough muscle memory that I have an ability to glue things together, but, my "from scratch" ability is still rather weak. The echos of hearing from the internet that I'm a fraud and a parasite (long story, not sharing more) are still loud.

Anyways, I've not read the post in full yet, but have added it to my reading list.

Enjoy!
