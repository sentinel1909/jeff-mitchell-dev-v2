I'm currently experiencing some technical difficulties with this blog site. For some reason, if you don't append "index.html" to the end of all routes, your browser will display an error page with "too many redirects".

I'll be exploring this further in the coming days, mostly to learn, but am also working behind the scenes on an alternate blog which will be hosted on Netlify. That is a few weeks...no wait, let's not be overly optimistic...months away though and am targeting the beginning of next year to make it go live.
