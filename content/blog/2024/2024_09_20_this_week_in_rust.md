I'm two days late with my link to [This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2024/09/18/this-week-in-rust-565/).

In my own week in Rust, I decided to stop the random drifting between useless personal projects that never go anywhere and instead focus on a work related project. I've built out an office intranet site with Yew. I had a knowledge breakthrough with form handling and events, which allowed me to bring the Yew site up to par functionally with the React version I'd previously built.

I also resumed work on the Actix Web backend for a Code interpretations knowledge base for my staff to use. I'm creating a searchable knowledge base of our internal building code related decisions and discussions. This week I managed to get it live to the point of being usable. Progress! Tasks for next week are to add update and delete functionality to the web form template I started for creating new entries.

This weekend I want to write something on generics and _may_ start to look at Diesel. Thus far in my Rust journey I've focused on using raw SQLx, but in discussing with others I can see maybe there's benefit in knowing one ORM.

I'm also going to start a series of pieces on Yew. I want to create a resource mostly for myself that I can look at to refresh on how to do things. The Yew docs are a hair weak in that regard. They assume you know what you're doing and have web dev experience, which I didn't have nearly as much as I should.

That's it! Hope you are all making progress in your own Rust journey...or whatever language you've chosen to focus on.
