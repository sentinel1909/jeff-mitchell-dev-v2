It's Friday, February 14th, in the Year of Our Lord 2025. Not sure why I'm doing the "Year of Our Lord" bit, just feels kinda fun.

Here is your "This Week in Rust" fix: [This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2025/02/12/this-week-in-rust-586/)

Lot's of good stuff there in this week's edition.

In my own week in Rust, I rembraced [Pavex](https://pavex.dev) which is now in open beta. I participated briefly in the closed beta last year, but drifted away from the project due to weak skills. I've returned now, perhaps a little stronger, and am intending to build some projects using Luca Palmieri's fresh and new framework. I re-joined the Discord group as well. It always amazes me how engaged and active Luca is there. Within a day, he answers questions.

I've decided I'm going to help the project by porting [actix-web-flash-messages](https://crates.io/crates/actix-web-flash-messages). I'm pushing myself, and I'm not sure I'll be able to do it, but Luca hinted it should be a relatively straightforward thing to port.

We shall see.

How was your own week in Rust?
