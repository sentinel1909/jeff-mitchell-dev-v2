This is a bit of a quickie post. I'd like to get back into the habit of posting a link to this week's [This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2025/01/22/this-week-in-rust-583/) edition.

Also, I found this: [Digital Consumption Keeps Me from Getting Better at My Job](https://sibervepunk.com/digital-consumption.html?ref=dailydev) to be a great read that rang a little too close to home.
